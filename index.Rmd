## Project thoughts

My project idea is to explore data related to differences in the 2014 and 2019 EU parliament elections in Italy.
Specifically, I will explore how one of the most prominent parties in 2014 dropped almost 20% in percentage points, and how different regions of Italy voted in both elections respectively. I will also analyze how education levels and age correlate to voting trends, and gather conclusions from the data.
